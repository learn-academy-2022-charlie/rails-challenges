As a user, I can visit a page called evenly that takes two numbers as params and displays whether or not the first number is evenly divisible by the second.

we created a new method called evenly

we made 2 variables that hold params of numbers

we then made an instanced variabled take those parameters and turn them into integers. 

We then used a ternary operator to check if the integer1 was evenly divisible by interger 2. 

We string interpolated if it was or was not.
